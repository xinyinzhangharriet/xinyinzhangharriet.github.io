best model XGBoost caused a 30% decrease in MSE.</li>
    <li>Multi-Label Prediction: Designed multi-label models to classify movie genres from posters, utilizing Binary
Relevance, Classifier Chain, and Label Powerset across 8 classifiers.</li>
    <li>Multi-Modal Alignment: Built a neural network combined with Resnet50 and DistilBert to align movie intros with
movie posters; optimizing performance with the cost function defined by cross entropy based on cosine similarity.</li>
