I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Guanghua School of Management](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). Initially, I focused on finance, but I am now deeply fascinated by computer science and data science.

Four parts will be included:
* Basic skills that college won't teach you.
